The Builder pattern is a good choice when designing classes whose constructors or static
factories would have more than a handful of parameters, especially if many of the parameters
are optional or indentical type.Client code is much easier to read and write with builders
than with telescoping constructors,and builders are much safer than JavaBeans.
