In summary, whenever you implement a value class that has a sensible ordering, you should have the class implement
the Comparable interface so that its instances can be easily sorted, searched, and used in comparison-based collections.
When comparing field values in the implementations of the compareTo methods, avoid the use of the < and > operators.
Instead, use the static compare methods in the boxed primitive classes or the comparator construction methods in
the Comparator interface.
