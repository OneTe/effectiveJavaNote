In summary, if a class has mutable components that it gets from or returns to its clients,
the class must defensively copy these components. If the cost of the copy would be prohibitive
and the class trusts its clients not to modify the components inappropriately, then the defensive
copy may be replaced by documentation outlining the clientâ€™s responsibility not to modify the
affected components.
