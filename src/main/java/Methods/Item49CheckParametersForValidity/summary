To summarize, each time you write a method or constructor, you should think about
what restrictions exist on its parameters. You should document these restrictions
and enforce them with explicit checks at the beginning of the method body. It is
important to get into the habit of doing this. The modest work that it entails will
be paid back with interest the first time a validity check fails.
