To summarize, just because you can overload methods doesn’t mean you should. It is
generally best to refrain from overloading methods with multiple signatures that have
the same number of parameters. In some cases, especially where constructors are involved,
it may be impossible to follow this advice. In these cases, you should at least avoid
situations where the same set of parameters can be passed to different overloadings by
the addition of casts. If this cannot be avoided, for example, because you are retrofitting
an existing class to implement a new interface, you should ensure that all overloadings
behave identically when passed the same parameters. If you fail to do this, programmers will
be hard pressed to make effective use of the overloaded method or constructor, and they won’t
understand why it doesn’t work.
