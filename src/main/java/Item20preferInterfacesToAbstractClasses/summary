1.Existing classes can be easily retrofitted to implement a new interface.
2.Interface are ideal for defining mixins.
3.Interfaces allow the construction of non hierarchical type frameworks.
4.Interfaces enable safe,powerful functionality enhancements.
5.You can combine the virtues of interfaces and abstract classes by providing an abstract.
 skeletal implementation class to go with each nontrivial interface that you export.
