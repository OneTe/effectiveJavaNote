The Java programming language provides three kinds of throwables:
1.checked exceptions
  use checked exceptions for conditions from which the caller can reasonably be expected to recover

2.runtime exceptions (unchecked exceptions)
  Use runtime exceptions to indicate programming errors
  all of the unchecked throwables you implement should subclass RuntimeException

3.errors


To summarize, throw checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and unchecked exceptions
for programming errors. When in doubt, throw unchecked exceptions. Donâ€™t define any throwables
that are neither checked exceptions nor runtime exceptions. Provide methods on your checked
exceptions to aid in recovery.
