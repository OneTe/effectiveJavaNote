Static utility methods are particularly good candidates for generification
All of the “algorithm” methods in Collections (such as binarySearch and sort) have been generified

In summary, generic methods, like generic types, are safer and easier to use
than methods requiring their clients to put explicit casts on input parameters
and return values. Like types, you should make sure that your methods can be used
without casts, which often means making them generic. And like types, you should
generify existing methods whose use requires casts. This makes life easier for new
users without breaking existing clients (Item 26).
