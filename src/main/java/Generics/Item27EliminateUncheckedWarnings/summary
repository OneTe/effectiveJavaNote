1.Unchecked warnings while using generic
    unchecked cast warnings
    unchecked method invocation warnings
    unchecked generic array creation warnings
    unchecked conversion warnings

2.@SuppressWarnings("unchecked") annotation
    If you can’t eliminate a warning, and you can prove that the code that provoked the warning is type-safe
    Always use the SuppressWarnings annotation on the smallest scope possible
    Every time you use an @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") annotation, add a comment saying why it’s safe to do so
