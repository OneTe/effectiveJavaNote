Generic types are safer and easier to use than types that require casts
in client code. When you design new types, make sure that they can be used
without such casts. This will often mean making the types generic. If you
have any existing types that should be generic but aren’t, generify them.
This will make life easier for new users of these types without breaking existing clients
