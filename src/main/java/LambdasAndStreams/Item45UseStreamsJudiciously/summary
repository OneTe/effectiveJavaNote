In summary, some tasks are best accomplished with streams, and others with iteration.
Many tasks are best accomplished by combining the two approaches. There are no hard and
fast rules for choosing which approach to use for a task, but there are some useful heuristics.
In many cases, it will be clear which approach to use; in some cases, it won’t. If you’re not
sure whether a task is better served by streams or iteration, try both and see which works better.
