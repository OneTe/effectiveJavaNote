Conclusion
All classes that implement Cloneable should override clone
clone() method should first call super.clone and then fix any fields that need to be fixed
Do not make any interface which extends cloneable
Do not implement cloneable for any classe designed for inheritance


Alternatives

Copy constructor
   public Yum(Yum yum);
Copy factory
   public static Yum newInstance(Yum yum);
