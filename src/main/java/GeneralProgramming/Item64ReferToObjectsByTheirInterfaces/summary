 1.If appropriate interface types exist, then parameters, return values, variables,
   and fields should all be declared using interface types.



 In practice, it should be apparent whether a given object has an appropriate interface.
 If it does, your program will be more flexible and stylish if you use the interface to
 refer to the object. If there is no appropriate interface, just use the least specific
 class in the class hierarchy that provides the required functionality.
