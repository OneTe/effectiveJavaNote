To summarize, avoid the natural tendency to represent objects as strings
when better data types exist or can be written. Used inappropriately, strings
are more cumbersome, less flexible, slower, and more error-prone than other types.
Types for which strings are commonly misused include primitive types, enums, and
aggregate types.
