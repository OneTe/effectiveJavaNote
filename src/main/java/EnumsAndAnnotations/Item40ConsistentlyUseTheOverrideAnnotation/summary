1.You should use the @Override annotation on every method declaration that
  you believe to override a superclass declaration.
2.the compiler can protect you from a great many errors if you use the Override
  annotation on every method declaration that you believe to override a supertype
  declaration, with one exception.
3.In concrete classes, you need not annotate methods that you believe to override
  abstract method declarations (though it is not harmful to do so).
