1.You must use an annotation if the marker applies to any program element other than a class or interface
2.If you want to define a type that does not have any new methods associated with it, a marker interface
  is the way to go.
3.If you want to mark program elements other than classes and interfaces, to allow for the possibility of
  adding more information to the marker in the future, or to fit the marker into a framework that already
  makes heavy use of annotation types, then a marker annotation is the correct choice.
